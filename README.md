# Event Logger Public Code Review

## Project Description
Event Logger is a tool designed to help customers log and review events in their applications which are received from a remote hardware device. This project is open for public code review to understand and get feedback on how I can improve my code.

## Features
- Easy integration with various applications
- Event logging through REST API
- Detailed event reports
- Customizable logging levels
- Secure and efficient storage
- Built frontend using React.js with Vite, hooks, context API, and state management, which allows user to edit/assign priority to received events, filters the event data based on event priority, allows user to download event log or send mail to given mail id.
- Developed backend using Express.js/Node.JS to receive security alert event logs, extracts event details from 
the log, stores it in the DB and provides processed data to the frontend.
